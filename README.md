# DN-s-Work-Day-Planner

Bootcamp Challenge 05 - Third Party API's: DN Work Day Planner

## The Challenge

Construct a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a 9AM to 5PM workday by modifying starter code. This application will run in the browser and feature dytnamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Acceptance Criteria for the webpage:
- When the planner application is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the scheduler
- When scrolling down, the 9AM to 5PM work day will be listed out
- Each timeblock will be colorcoded to indicate past, persent, or future
- Upon clicking into a timeblock, an event can be typed into that timeblock
- After clicking the save button next to the input text, the text is saved in local storage
- Also when the page is refreshed, the data will remain on the page

## Mock-Up

![A user scrolls through an interactive work day planner, inputs an event within a timeblock, clicks the save button, then refreshes the page to see all previous inputs in the same timeblocks](./Assets/DN's%20Work%20Day%20Planner.gif)

## The Process

To meet the acceptance criteria, the following had to be done:
- research on jQuery well enough to understand the different functions and how each function works alongside one another
- using previous class instructor/activities guides to develop code to get the desired app outcome
- troubleshoot fine details for app functionality
- as a bonus, I included the current time for the sake of the accuracy of the planner
